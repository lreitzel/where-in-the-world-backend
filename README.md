# README

This is the backend or API side of the application Where In The World Is Your Recipe. To begin, you should fork and clone this repo onto your local machine. Then you'll need to run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed. Lastly you can run rails s to start the server. Next you'll want to go to the frontend of the application and get it running! 

Access the frontend here: https://github.com/lreitzel/where-in-the-world-frontend

I hope you enjoy it!
